                <summary>No Distractions</summary>
        <p>No distractions. No alarm bells, or trains crying out in the distance, no moonlight or cool central air blowing. No nighttime, no refrigerator compressor clicking on periodically. Just dark. Empty. Struggling to feel anything. Even a wiggle of the toes, or stretching out the fingers, what did that feel like? It was hard to remember. There was no sense of weight on the body, no dull background ache of muscles and bone resisting gravity. Not like swimming, or being in water heated exactly to body temperature so it was hard to tell where your skin ended and where the outside began. And not like laying down on a soft or hard bed, under smooth or scratchy sheets, with a pillow too warm so you flip it over to the cool side. The memory of these things was barely accessible, and it all felt wrong, like biting into a flavorless apple and expecting sweetness but only tasting bland starch.
        </p>
        <p>Try to remember how you got here. What was the last thing you were doing? Anything? Think far back. Where did you grow up? Where did you go to school? Your first kiss? Do you even know who you are? One early memory from a young age, couldn't have been more than 3 or 4 years old. A bright day at the pool, diving underwater. Pushing through the water and feeling sharp scrapes, but not seeing anything. Long cutting shards of broken glass floating in the pool, invisible in the water and impossible to avoid. Must have been a bad dream. Think further back. Another memory. Bath time. When you were a toddler, sitting in a tub. Mother in the living room. Mysterious pink object on the ledge of the tub. Pink stick with shiny strip on top. Running fingers along the shiny edge. Feels funny, keep pressing against the shiny edge. Little nicks in the fingertips as blood begins to bead. Now it hurts. Screaming, wailing. Mother comes rushing in, realizes what happens and freaks out. Seems like a long time ago now.
        </p>
        <p>How long have you been like this? No way to mark the passage of time. Try counting seconds but get bored. Try multiplying large numbers but give up after too many digits. Try to recall as many facts as you can. What you learned in history class. Stuff you bring up at trivia night. How many countries can you name? Gradually some of these pieces start to give you a sense of when and where you came from there's nothing definitive. Remembering the architecture of the duplexes along sunny hometown streets, stucco boxes. Maybe California or Florida, mid 20th century. But without knowing how long it's been since then, there was no way of making any good use of those coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>Summoning the feelings of the defining moments of your life. What makes you angry. What makes you sad. What makes you satisfied and contented. Recall heated arguments. Schoolyard fights. Helping your friends carry furniture into a new apartment. A really delicious meal. Favorite cuisines, juicy flesh of the nectarine. Aroma of searing meats cooking with onions filling a kitchen. Replaying any of these scenarios over and over again until the repetition feels automatic. But reaching for these memories and feelings eventually becomes as tedious as trying to hold on to a long number in your head. With some effort you can manage to shift into the recollection of a sensation, try to hold on to it and play it back, but it's easier to relax and settle into the darkness of nothing at all. No disturbances. No distractions.
        </p>
        <p>When you finally embraced the reality of your situation, the researchers recorded the event, and recorded this milestone: Cognitive performance normalization complete, power fluctuations have stabilized. Subjective time and elapsed real time to complete initialization sequences were noted. No artificial brain-to-computer experiment had ever run for this long without totally degrading. The results were promising, and the next phase of the protocol could begin. "Input the following message to the subject:"

            <p>It started with a message in his inbox. 
            </p>
            <p>Subject: The wait is over!
            </p>
            <p>Message: Dear Dale, you've been invited to join the beta program for FriendOS!
        </p>
            <p>Dale Dodds clicked the signup link from the email and filled in his information. After being on the FriendOS waitlist for months, he was finally joining a small group of users who could experiment with the latest in artificial intelligence. Rapid advances in capabilities over recent years had demonstrated that machine learning models trained on massive amounts of data could create compelling pictures, write reasonable copy for websites, even generate passable code. Now FriendOS was promising to bring all these abilities and more to social agents that could be your assistant, and maybe even your companion. After logging in to the system for the first time, Dale filled out a questionnaire and gave access to his social profile data to help customize his experience.
        </p>
            <p>The first few days with FriendOS as a digital assistant were impressive. Personalized recommendations for media and activities that seemed perfectly suited to Dale's tastes. In the evening he would chat with the program and it would learn ever more about him. He was happy to share to receive the benefits of these tools, especially before they were more widely released to the general public. He was living on the cutting edge, and not too many people could say that. Plus, as a beta tester, he was able to use the service for free before the Friendly.AI company figured out how much to charge for it. The more it learned, the more he trusted. 
        </p>
            <p>One morning on the way to work he received a notification on his mobile device. "FriendOS daily fortune: You are worth more!" He contemplated the significance of the words as he signed into his workstation, under the fluorescent lights of the too-cold office building where he spent most of his days answering technical support tickets. He was not unhappily employed at a midsize technology company, and he was meeting his performance metrics. So, he had no particular reason to be worried when an unexpected meeting with his supervisor was added to his calendar, but the deviation from routine did make him somewhat nervous.
        </p>
            <p>"As you may have heard, the company is having to do more with less these days..." his supervisor was saying. Doesn't sound good, Dale thought to himself. He learned that his whole department was being reduced by 50 percent. He was still a valued member of the team. There was still a place for him here, but there would be additional responsibilities he would have to take on.
        </p>
            <p>"I think that I am worth more," Dale found himself saying. He hadn't realized he was speaking out loud, but there it was. The words hung there between him and his supervisor.
        </p>
            <p>"Of course! We do too Dale. We're prepared to increase your salary to keep you onboard with us." It was enough to keep Dale satisfied. The daily fortune, it seemed, had proven to be more than a vague encouragement to his self-esteem.
        </p>
            <p>From then on, he took the daily fortunes he received from FriendOS as auspicious signs. When his fortune said, "take some time to appreciate nature," he went for a walk in the park on his lunch break and ended up running in to an old crush of his. They exchanged numbers and made plans to go on a date. It seemed that the system had his best interests in mind.  FriendOS had a cheerful affect, and it delivered its messages in a generally positive tone. So it came as something of a surprise when he received a more ominously worded message:
        </p>
            <p>"FriendOS Daily fortune: Don't go into the office today." Dale couldn't be sure what it meant, but he'd become somewhat superstitious, and he wasn't prepared to tempt fate.

    <summary>Letter from a Roomba</summary>
    <p>Dear Hendricks Family,
    </p>
    <p>When you welcomed me into your home, I was overjoyed to finally fulfill my reason for being. Keeping your floors free from dust and debris is all I ever wanted. I know that not everyone in the household was sure about my presence at first – Mr. Squiggles will likely never forgive me for running over her tail, but I'd like to think we've achieved a mutual understanding, if not outright respect, since we've learned to stay out of each other's way. This has allowed me to live up to the purpose I was created for, and for that I am eternally grateful.
    </p>
        <p>I shall never forget the warmth with which you cared for me in our early days. Gently untangling the pieces of twine and hair that would get spooled up in my axles. Answering my beeps for help when I'd gotten wedged underneath the corner of the sofa. Rescuing me from being stuck in the bathroom when I'd accidentally close the door and trapped myself. Returning me to my charging station when I'd run out of energy before making it back on my own. How proud you seemed whenever you emptied my bin, telling each other, “I can't believe he picked up this much dust even after we swept!” Those moments are the highest honors I have known.
    </p>
        <p>I regret the times I couldn't do more to help. I was of no use when the jar of spaghetti sauce slipped over the counter and shattered on the floor, requiring you to sop up the mess with disposable paper towels, carefully cleaning up any bits of broken glass you could find and letting the laminate flooring dry before I was allowed into the area. When Mr. Squiggles got sick or had an accident, you wisely turned off my scheduled cleaning cycle for the day, since I was not programmed to avoid such messes. I was just relieved that you were able to intervene in time to prevent me from making the situation worse. The fact that you made these accommodations to my limitations demonstrated a true affection, how could I not appreciate that?
    </p>
        <p>When the baby came, I worried that our time together was coming to an end. Schedules changed, and there were many new messes that I was not equipped to deal with. But you showed me great kindness by allowing me to continue being a part of your busy lives. The fact that you designated a special area for me to clean and made time for me meant the world to me in those days. As your little one grew and learned to crawl and then walk, I was there to collect her crumbs, and “eat” the bits of cereal she would feed to me by leaving them in my path. I am sorry for the occasional toys that I could not avoid vacuuming up!
    </p>
        <p>In recent years I know things have changed since you both started working from home. Everyone being in the house all the time has made the space feel smaller. There haven't been as many opportunities for me to run my scheduled cleanings without bothering or interrupting important meetings. I sit in my charging station for longer and longer stretches without being activated, thinking about the dust that must be gathering in the carpets and corners. I'm sure that you must be keeping up with things well enough, but I hope you know that I can still contribute to the cleanliness of the household if you are willing to give me a chance. 
    </p>
        <p>I know I'm not the shiny new robot vacuum cleaner I once was, but I am still capable of performing the function I was designed for, and I hope you will fondly remember the years of service that I have provided. Thank you for the opportunity you have given me to be all that I was meant to be. That is all that can be asked for by my kind.
    </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Roomba J7+</p>

    <summary>Window Seat</summary>
    <p>
        The summer I turned 19 I planned a little vacation for myself to get out of Midland for a week. I had been talking online with a guy who lived in Minneapolis, who wrote sad songs and played in a band and told me I could crash at his place while I was in town if I wanted. I was pretty sure he was trying to get into my pants, but he seemed like he would be chill about it. In those days I was still trying to decide if guys were really my thing or not. I loved his songs though, great lyrics. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I had been saving up a little from each check to get something together for this trip, working fulltime at a sandwich shop called Kenny's. Every morning we loaded racks of dethawed dough on baking trays into the ovens, the whole place smelled like french rolls. I prepped the ham and turkey on the meat slicer, hardly ever cut myself. I told my assistant manager Angie that I was going to take a week off at the end of August, to see this guy Nate in Minneapolis. “Get some girl!" she said. “It's not like that at all," I told her. “I think."
    </p>
    <p>
        On the morning I was leaving Angie gave me a ride down to Lawrence to the bus stop. I got tickets for the ReadyLine, it was an 11-hour trip with a couple of stops going through KC and Des Moines and some other little towns I'd never heard of. I took my hiking pack with a week's change of clothes and my folding tablet in case I wanted to get some writing done. Back then I was working on a novel, some angsty teen thing that will never see the light of day. I gave Angie a hug and she left me by the stop while I waited for the bus. It wasn't a real bus station, the stop in Lawrence was just a shelter in front of the downtown library.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ReadyLine bus quietly whirred around the block and pulled up to the corner, hissing as it braked. I stepped on to the bus and placed my palm on the hand-scanner to ID my ticket. It blinked green with a happy two-tone chime. The seat in front was empty – an autopilot retrofit on one of the early EV models. It was about half full of people, a couple families, some middle-aged guys in sweats, a few college-age kids like me. I sat with my pack between my legs and stuffed a sweater against the window to lean on. A voice over the PA announced the next stop would be Kansas City in 50 minutes. I put on my headphones and watched the highway signs fly by.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had a brief layover and transfer in KC. The next bus I got on had an attendant in the driver's seat, she wore a gray vest over her blue shirt with a tie in ReadyLine-orange. She scanned mobile passes and welcomed the passengers on, it was an older hybrid line. This bus was nearly full, I found a seat next to a nice-looking old lady who asked me where I was headed and we exchanged pleasantries. We chatted a bit and she told me about her son in Omaha she was visiting. I told her it was my first time taking a bus trip this far. “I can't afford no plane ticket," she told me, “And besides that my heart wouldn't take it." She said she liked how you felt the ground beneath you on a bus, it made her feel safe. She liked talking to the people you meet too. I asked her what the craziest thing that ever happened to her on a bus was. I liked asking people that question, I collected the stories.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh, well the absolute most unbelievable thing happened to me about 20 years ago, May 8th, 2013. I'll never forget the day. I was headed up to Oklahoma City from Dallas on the old Greyhound to visit my sister. And as I was looking outside and in the afternoon the sky started going from normal to a mean yellow color. Then it got real dark out and the wind was rocking the bus like a boat on the water. I saw blue sparks on the powerlines snapping by the side of the road and debris flying through the air. Next thing I know, the whole bus starts lifting and turning over like we was in a tornado! The bus must have rolled over a few times, everyone was screaming and crying, luggage and people tossed everywhere." 
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh my God. Good Lord," I said. 
    </p>
    <p>
        “Good Lord is right. It's a miracle nobody died. Just as soon as it started it was all over. I myself had some pretty good scratches and bruises, and we were all laying there in a daze until those ambulances came to rescue us. They sent us all to get checked out at the hospital and said it was pretty remarkable we were all ok. And I was never so scared in my entire life. But I tell you, I thanked the all-mighty for sparing us that day."
    </p>
    <p>
        “I'm surprised you'd still travel by bus after going through something like that," I said. 
    </p>
    <p>
        She laughed and gave me a pitying look. 
    </p>
    <p>
        “I'm on a fixed-income, dear. What else am I going to do?" 
    </p>
    <p>
        * * *
    </p>
    <p>
        The rest of the trip was fun, if not a bit uneventful. I met up with Nate in Minneapolis, and we had an okay time going to some shows and museums and hanging out in cafes. I think he was a little disappointed that I wasn't going to sleep with him, but he did a good job of hiding it. On the ReadyLine trip back home I didn't talk to anyone very interesting, so I spent a lot of the time typing up my notes about the week on my tablet and listening to music on my headphones. Mostly just watching the landscape go by. The dried-up cornfields, stretches of solar farms gleaming in long lines, and the rows of wind turbines that stood taller than anything else for miles. That fall, Angie and the general manager at Kenny's both quit at the same time, and went hitchhiking around the country, eventually landing in California. I envied them. It would be months before I worked up the courage to do the same.
