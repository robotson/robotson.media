        <p>No distractions. No alarm bells, or trains crying out in the distance, no moonlight or cool central air blowing. No nighttime, no refrigerator compressor clicking on periodically. Just dark. Empty. Struggling to feel anything. Even a wiggle of the toes, or stretching out the fingers, what did that feel like? It was hard to remember. There was no sense of weight on the body, no dull background ache of muscles and bone resisting gravity. Not like swimming, or being in water heated exactly to body temperature so it was hard to tell where your skin ended and where the outside began. And not like laying down on a soft or hard bed, under smooth or scratchy sheets, with a pillow too warm so you flip it over to the cool side. The memory of these things was barely accessible, and it all felt wrong, like biting into a flavorless apple and expecting sweetness but only tasting bland starch.

        <p>Try to remember how you got here. What was the last thing you were doing? Anything? Think far back. Where did you grow up? Where did you go to school? Your first kiss? Do you even know who you are? One early memory from a young age, couldn't have been more than 3 or 4 years old. A bright day at the pool, diving underwater. Pushing through the water and feeling sharp scrapes, but not seeing anything. Long cutting shards of broken glass floating in the pool, invisible in the water and impossible to avoid. Must have been a bad dream. Think further back. Another memory. Bath time. When you were a toddler, sitting in a tub. Mother in the living room. Mysterious pink object on the ledge of the tub. Pink stick with shiny strip on top. Running fingers along the shiny edge. Feels funny, keep pressing against the shiny edge. Little nicks in the fingertips as blood begins to bead. Now it hurts. Screaming, wailing. Mother comes rushing in, realizes what happens and freaks out. Seems like a long time ago now.

        <p>How long have you been like this? No way to mark the passage of time. Try counting seconds but get bored. Try multiplying large numbers but give up after too many digits. Try to recall as many facts as you can. What you learned in history class. Stuff you bring up at trivia night. How many countries can you name? Gradually some of these pieces start to give you a sense of when and where you came from there's nothing definitive. Remembering the architecture of the duplexes along sunny hometown streets, stucco boxes. Maybe California or Florida, mid 20th century. But without knowing how long it's been since then, there was no way of making any good use of those coordinates.

        <p>Summoning the feelings of the defining moments of your life. What makes you angry. What makes you sad. What makes you satisfied and contented. Recall heated arguments. Schoolyard fights. Helping your friends carry furniture into a new apartment. A really delicious meal. Favorite cuisines, juicy flesh of the nectarine. Aroma of searing meats cooking with onions filling a kitchen. Replaying any of these scenarios over and over again until the repetition feels automatic. But reaching for these memories and feelings eventually becomes as tedious as trying to hold on to a long number in your head. With some effort you can manage to shift into the recollection of a sensation, try to hold on to it and play it back, but it's easier to relax and settle into the darkness of nothing at all. No disturbances. No distractions.

        <p>When you finally embraced the reality of your situation, the researchers recorded the event, and recorded this milestone: Cognitive performance normalization complete, power fluctuations have stabilized. Subjective time and elapsed real time to complete initialization sequences were noted. No artificial brain-to-computer experiment had ever run for this long without totally degrading. The results were promising, and the next phase of the protocol could begin. "Input the following message to the subject:"
