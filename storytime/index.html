                <summary>No Distractions</summary>
        <p>No distractions. No alarm bells, or trains crying out in the distance, no moonlight or cool central air blowing. No nighttime, no refrigerator compressor clicking on periodically. Just dark. Empty. Struggling to feel anything. Even a wiggle of the toes, or stretching out the fingers, what did that feel like? It was hard to remember. There was no sense of weight on the body, no dull background ache of muscles and bone resisting gravity. Not like swimming, or being in water heated exactly to body temperature so it was hard to tell where your skin ended and where the outside began. And not like laying down on a soft or hard bed, under smooth or scratchy sheets, with a pillow too warm so you flip it over to the cool side. The memory of these things was barely accessible, and it all felt wrong, like biting into a flavorless apple and expecting sweetness but only tasting bland starch.
        </p>
        <p>Try to remember how you got here. What was the last thing you were doing? Anything? Think far back. Where did you grow up? Where did you go to school? Your first kiss? Do you even know who you are? One early memory from a young age, couldn't have been more than 3 or 4 years old. A bright day at the pool, diving underwater. Pushing through the water and feeling sharp scrapes, but not seeing anything. Long cutting shards of broken glass floating in the pool, invisible in the water and impossible to avoid. Must have been a bad dream. Think further back. Another memory. Bath time. When you were a toddler, sitting in a tub. Mother in the living room. Mysterious pink object on the ledge of the tub. Pink stick with shiny strip on top. Running fingers along the shiny edge. Feels funny, keep pressing against the shiny edge. Little nicks in the fingertips as blood begins to bead. Now it hurts. Screaming, wailing. Mother comes rushing in, realizes what happens and freaks out. Seems like a long time ago now.
        </p>
        <p>How long have you been like this? No way to mark the passage of time. Try counting seconds but get bored. Try multiplying large numbers but give up after too many digits. Try to recall as many facts as you can. What you learned in history class. Stuff you bring up at trivia night. How many countries can you name? Gradually some of these pieces start to give you a sense of when and where you came from there's nothing definitive. Remembering the architecture of the duplexes along sunny hometown streets, stucco boxes. Maybe California or Florida, mid 20th century. But without knowing how long it's been since then, there was no way of making any good use of those coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>Summoning the feelings of the defining moments of your life. What makes you angry. What makes you sad. What makes you satisfied and contented. Recall heated arguments. Schoolyard fights. Helping your friends carry furniture into a new apartment. A really delicious meal. Favorite cuisines, juicy flesh of the nectarine. Aroma of searing meats cooking with onions filling a kitchen. Replaying any of these scenarios over and over again until the repetition feels automatic. But reaching for these memories and feelings eventually becomes as tedious as trying to hold on to a long number in your head. With some effort you can manage to shift into the recollection of a sensation, try to hold on to it and play it back, but it's easier to relax and settle into the darkness of nothing at all. No disturbances. No distractions.

        <p>When you finally embraced the reality of your situation, the researchers recorded the event, and recorded this milestone: Cognitive performance normalization complete, power fluctuations have stabilized. Subjective time and elapsed real time to complete initialization sequences were noted. No artificial brain-to-computer experiment had ever run for this long without totally degrading. The results were promising, and the next phase of the protocol could begin. "Input the following message to the subject:"

            <p>It started with a message in his inbox. 
            </p>
            <p>Subject: The wait is over!
            </p>
            <p>Message: Dear Dale, you've been invited to join the beta program for FriendOS!
        </p>
            <p>Dale Dodds clicked the signup link from the email and filled in his information. After being on the FriendOS waitlist for months, he was finally joining a small group of users who could experiment with the latest in artificial intelligence. Rapid advances in capabilities over recent years had demonstrated that machine learning models trained on massive amounts of data could create compelling pictures, write reasonable copy for websites, even generate passable code. Now FriendOS was promising to bring all these abilities and more to social agents that could be your assistant, and maybe even your companion. After logging in to the system for the first time, Dale filled out a questionnaire and gave access to his social profile data to help customize his experience.
        </p>
            <p>The first few days with FriendOS as a digital assistant were impressive. Personalized recommendations for media and activities that seemed perfectly suited to Dale's tastes. In the evening he would chat with the program and it would learn ever more about him. He was happy to share to receive the benefits of these tools, especially before they were more widely released to the general public. He was living on the cutting edge, and not too many people could say that. Plus, as a beta tester, he was able to use the service for free before the Friendly.AI company figured out how much to charge for it. The more it learned, the more he trusted. 
        </p>
            <p>One morning on the way to work he received a notification on his mobile device. "FriendOS daily fortune: You are worth more!" He contemplated the significance of the words as he signed into his workstation, under the fluorescent lights of the too-cold office building where he spent most of his days answering technical support tickets. He was not unhappily employed at a midsize technology company, and he was meeting his performance metrics. So, he had no particular reason to be worried when an unexpected meeting with his supervisor was added to his calendar, but the deviation from routine did make him somewhat nervous.
        </p>
            <p>"As you may have heard, the company is having to do more with less these days..." his supervisor was saying. Doesn't sound good, Dale thought to himself. He learned that his whole department was being reduced by 50 percent. He was still a valued member of the team. There was still a place for him here, but there would be additional responsibilities he would have to take on.
        </p>
            <p>"I think that I am worth more," Dale found himself saying. He hadn't realized he was speaking out loud, but there it was. The words hung there between him and his supervisor.
        </p>
            <p>"Of course! We do too Dale. We're prepared to increase your salary to keep you onboard with us." It was enough to keep Dale satisfied. The daily fortune, it seemed, had proven to be more than a vague encouragement to his self-esteem.
        </p>
            <p>From then on, he took the daily fortunes he received from FriendOS as auspicious signs. When his fortune said, "take some time to appreciate nature," he went for a walk in the park on his lunch break and ended up running in to an old crush of his. They exchanged numbers and made plans to go on a date. It seemed that the system had his best interests in mind.Â  FriendOS had a cheerful affect, and it delivered its messages in a generally positive tone. So it came as something of a surprise when he received a more ominously worded message:
        </p>
            <p>"FriendOS Daily fortune: Don't go into the office today." Dale couldn't be sure what it meant, but he'd become somewhat superstitious, and he wasn't prepared to tempt fate.
